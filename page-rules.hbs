        <strong class="section">Gameplay Rules</strong><br>
        We only have a handful of rules regarding actual gameplay! The following are not allowed.<br>
        <ul>
            <li>Griefing within town boundaries. Do not break, or otherwise alter, another players’ build that is towny claimed, without their permission.</li>
            <li>Stealing and/or any form of theft within town boundaries.</li>
            <li>Intentionally killing someone outside of PVP areas. This includes tp/trap killing players.</li>
            <li>Scamming other users via trades, auctions and/or other transactions.</li>
            <li> Teleport/move between multiple loaded grinders to get more mob kills.</li>
        
            <li>If a resident is inactive for over 7 days, the Mayor has the right to remove them from the town.
            Mayors may remove players’ builds at their discretion if:
                <ol>
                    <li>The player has left the town</li>
                    <li>They have not been online for over 7 days.</li>
                </ol>
            <p>However, the Mayor must give them a 3 day notice before hand, and allow the player to remove it if they want.</p>
            </li>
            <li> Mayors are permitted to set town rules. If residents do not follow these, Mayors are allowed to enforce them by evicting them from the town.</li>
            <li>Player Warp Guidelines:</li>
                <ol>
                    <li>Warp names can't be claimed for "future projects". As soon as you claim them, they have to lead somewhere.</li>
                    <li>Warp names can't be misleading. (Ex. '/pw soccer' should not lead to a swimming pool)</li>
                    <li>Duplicate warps are not allowed. (Ex. You can't have both '/pw shop' &amp; '/pw market' lead to the same location. However, sectional warps are still allowed. (Ex. '/pw ore' &amp; '/pw wool' being in the same shop.))</li>
                    <br>
                    If you happen to run into a warp name that you would like to own yourself and you notice it breaks these rules or is inactive you are allowed to ask staff to remove the warp so you can claim it.
                    This change will never happen before internal discussion within the staff team.

        <strong class="section">Building Expectations</strong><br>
        Yes, we are an open world sandbox server, however, please do not intentionally intrude on someone else's private space out there in the wilderness. Do not troll people by building stuff around their town borders or similar actions.
        <ul>
            <li>Grief is not permitted within town boundaries. Do not break, or otherwise alter, another players’ build that is towny claimed, without their permission.</li>

            <li>No inappropriate builds.</li>

            <br>
            <strong>Due to performance issues:</strong>
            <li>Mob farms that use water flooding based on redstone timers are not allowed.</li>
